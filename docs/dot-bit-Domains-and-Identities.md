# Blockchain Domain Names and Identities

`.bit` domains and public identities are currently stored in the Namecoin network. It's very similar to the Bitcoin network, but designed for domain names.

All of this must currently be done using `namecoind`, a daemon that DNSChain requires running in the background to access the Namecoin network.

See the [Namecoin wiki](https://github.com/namecoin/wiki/wiki) for more info:
